Version: 1.0.11
Date: 2023-??-??
  Added:
    - a new way to change inserter drop/pickup without opening it's gui (to change the offset you need to use the shortcut)
  Bugfixes:
    - Locked shortcut (hotkeys) behind technologies
  Planned:
    - a shortcut (hotkey) to switch between the near and far side of the belt
  Changes:
    - compatibility with rendai trasportation not planned anymore, if you have any idea about how to implement it contace me on telegram t.me/smastermega
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.10
Date: 2023-10-17
  Bugfixes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.9
Date: 2023-10-16
  Added:
    - Hotkeys for pickup-offset
  Bugfixes:
    - distance adjust hotkeys (if you know a way to read minds to implement the other diagonals tell me)
    - rotation adjust hotkeys
  Changes:
    - Configuration UI is now disabled for miniloader and RenaiTramsportation mods
    - Pick-Drop ui is now centred
    - Slim inserter settings are now hidden if none are detected (sorta, it only checks if known slim inserter mod are present due to factorio limitation)
    - Corrected some part of my terrible english in the changelog
    - Small optimizations to the disable-long-inserter script
  Maybe:
    - Compatibility with RenaiTramsportation (this is going to be a headache...)
  Notes:
    - hotkeys are disabled in slim/big inserter due to mental health limitations, the support will come in the next update hopefully (too much math for my poor brain)
    - If arrow inserter and RenaiTramsportation are installed, RenaiTramsportation will crash and Smart_inserter will appear in the crash log, it's NOT smart_inserter fault (smart inserter does not affect the distance of the inserter in the data phase)
