Version: 2.0.0
Date: 2024-10-20
  Warning:
    - This is a full rewrite of the mod, some features have changed so it may take some time to get used to it (it shouldn't be hard)
    - The mod SHOULD be stable and backward compatible but if you're on a big world or an important one you should make a backup before updating
  Changes:
    - New UI, it may look similar but it's Yafla inside
    - New icons
    - Right-click change pickup
    - Left click change drop
    - Shift inveert right/lesft click
    - Control on any will switch pick and drop
    - Offset will not change when changing position/rotation (may change)
    - Shortcut now support slim and oddly shaped inserters
    - New UI for the in-world selector
  Added:
    - Rebase setting / incremental-with-rebase / inserter-with-rebase, the rabese setting will prevent an inserter to move it's range below is default range, so a long inserter wont' be able to place to the tiles adjacent itself
    - Pick/Drop on the same tile
    - Support for 2x2, 2x3, 3x2, slim, and any strange inserters up to 6x6, it SHOULD work for bigger inserters but do not quote me on that
    - Shortcut now support slim and oddly shaped inserters
    - Shortcut to adjust the distance in the opposite direction (expand and retract, before it worked only expand)
    - Support for in-world selector on slim or odd shaped inserters
  Removed:
    - Copy-paste selector, this caused more problems than anything so it was not worth the time and problems it caused, it may come back in the future
    - shortcut to fine control offsets, only near and far are available now, the shortcut should be fast if you want granular control open the GUI
  Modding:
    - If you want to add support for your mod you can use events.on_inserter_arm_changed to be notified when something happens, this is used internally for GUI updates so you should not miss anything
  Notes:
    - I did not test slim inserters of odd shapes like 3-0, or 0-3, consider these as not supported if you encounter any of them, the current code is not far away from supporting them, but I don't feel like spending the time to implement a use case that does not exist    
  Known Issues:
    - coping settings from inserters of different sizes (2x2 to 3x3) will probably move the pickup/drop out of the grid
    - If the inserter position is invalid the pickup/drop will not appear on the grid so you will not be able to change it
    - if the offset is too close to the border the first time you rotate it may change position, this ONLY HAPPENS when the position is not set with this mod
    - This update made the mod kinda slow again while rewriting the code I disabled matrix caching, I'll re-enable it in the future
  Planned:
    - Inserter presets, i'ts just an idea for now, I'm brainstorming ideas to implement it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.16
Date: 2024-07-09
  Bugfixes:
    - Slim inserter copy past was broken
  Added:
    - A setting to disable inserter power usare (false by default)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.15
Date: 2024-03-27
  Bugfixes:
    - en localization was displaying 3x3 where not needed
    - it localization was displaying 3x3 where not needed
    - Fixed a bug with the technology level 5
    - Fixed a bug with the diagonal calculations
  Changes:
    - Downgraded incremental setting by 1 tile due to the new technology (now the increment start from 0 instead of 1)
    - Removed 1.2.13 from the mod portal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.14
Date: 2024-03-26
  Added:
    - Support for slim inserter in the in-world selector
    - Quick far/near hotkey for the offset ("smart-inserters-drop-..-adjust-distance")
    - New technology for range = 6
  Changes:
    - RENAMED all the offset shortcuts internally 
    - - "smart-inserters-..-offset-adjust-lateral" -> "smart-inserters-drop-..-adjust-horizontal"
    - - "smart-inserters-..-offset-adjust-distance" -> "smart-inserters-drop-..-adjust-vertical"
    - - "smart-inserters-drop-..-adjust-distance" now mean the general offset distance
    - MASSIVE optimization for bigger grids (though 6 and 5 will probably still be quite slow in the in-world selector)
    - Incremented max distance from 5 to 6
    - Optimized the in-world selector
    - Started migration of core components to YAFLA (Yet Another Factorio Library Attempt)
    - Code cleanup
    - Localized switch in bigger inserters
  Bugfixes:
    - For some reason, the Incremental setting added a tile to the max range (now the max incremental range is reachable)
  Notes:
    - If you plan on using QAI with this mod you may want to remap the shortcuts of the in-world configurator
  Planned:
    - Switch the toggle button to a checkbox in the copy-paste configurator
    - A Remote to use some functions of SI and get information such as the max range of an inserter or general range/ matrix of allowed positions and so on...
    - Firing an event when the player changes the inserter position (Also handle this event internally for better compatibility with other mods)
    - A new mod appeared While I was doing this update (QAI) the author added compatibility with this mod itself
    - - I was planning on moving some settings to "map settings" but I may not do this anymore or at least not now 
    - Some of the features of QAI are not currently supported by SI
    - - pickup/Drop on the same tile will become a setting in the future
    - - Long inserter can't catch items near them, I did not think of this feature I'll add a setting in the future
    - If you use the new shortcut on slim inserter the first time the direction may not change and you might need to use it again (it's not the best but it greatly reduces code complexity, I'll fix it in the future) 
  Maybe:
    - - "Mirrored Inserters only" is not something that will be implemented for now since SI does not change the inserter starting position, but I may add some stuff like this in the copy-paste configurator
    - I'm thinking of a way to select some inserters and change all their position at the same time, this feature will need quite a bit of development so if it ever comes to light it will be in the far future

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2023-10-26
  Added:
    - a new way to change inserter drop/pickup without opening its GUI (to change the offset you need to use the shortcut)
  Bugfixes:

    - Since I have no friends (maybe) the world selector is not tested in multiplayer, expect bugs!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.10
Date: 2023-10-17
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed mod-checking the hotkeys even when it shouldn't

  Bugfixes:
    - distance adjust hotkeys (if you know a way to read minds to implement the other diagonals tell me)
    - rotation adjust hotkeys
  Changes:
    - Configuration UI is now disabled for mini loader and RenaiTramsportation mods
    - pickup-Drop UI is now centered
    - Slim inserter settings are now hidden if none are detected (sorta, it only checks if known slim inserter mods are present due to Factorio limitations)
    - Corrected some parts of my terrible English in the changelog
    - Small optimizations to the disable-long-inserter script
  Maybe:
    - Compatibility with RenaiTramsportation (this is going to be a headache...)
  Notes:
    - hotkeys are disabled in slim/big inserter due to mental health limitations, the support will come in the next update hopefully (too much math for my poor brain)
    - If arrow inserter and RenaiTramsportation are installed, RenaiTramsportation will crash and Smart_inserter will appear in the crash log, it's NOT smart_inserter fault (smart inserter does not affect the distance of the inserter in the data phase)

  Added:
    - Technology to unlock inserters range (off by default)

Date: 2023-08-15
