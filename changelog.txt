---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2023-10-26
  Added:
    - a new way to change inserter drop/pickup without opening its GUI (to change the offset you need to use the shortcut)
  Bugfixes:
    - Locked shortcuts (hotkeys) behind technologies
  Changes:
    - The welcome message now is localized
    - migrated inserter-config to smart-inserter (internal naming)

    - Support for Slim/arrow inserter in the new positioning mode
    - Support for big inserter in the new positioning mode
  Known Issues:

    - The new placer does not work with blueprint sandboxes
  Notes:
    - Since I have no friends (maybe) the world selector is not tested in multiplayer, expect bugs!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.10
Date: 2023-10-17
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed mod-checking the hotkeys even when it shouldn't
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.9
Date: 2023-10-16
  Added:
    - Hotkeys for pickup-offset
  Bugfixes:
    - distance adjust hotkeys (if you know a way to read minds to implement the other diagonals tell me)
    - rotation adjust hotkeys
  Changes:
    - Configuration UI is now disabled for mini loader and RenaiTramsportation mods
    - Pick-Drop UI is now centered
    - Slim inserter settings are now hidden if none are detected (sorta, it only checks if known slim inserter mods are present due to Factorio limitations)
    - Corrected some parts of my terrible English in the changelog
    - Small optimizations to the disable-long-inserter script
  Maybe:
    - Compatibility with RenaiTramsportation (this is going to be a headache...)
  Notes:
    - hotkeys are disabled in slim/big inserter due to mental health limitations, the support will come in the next update hopefully (too much math for my poor brain)
    - If arrow inserter and RenaiTramsportation are installed, RenaiTramsportation will crash and Smart_inserter will appear in the crash log, it's NOT smart_inserter fault (smart inserter does not affect the distance of the inserter in the data phase)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Technology to unlock inserters range (off by default)
